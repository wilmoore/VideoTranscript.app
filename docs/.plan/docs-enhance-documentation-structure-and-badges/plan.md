# Documentation Enhancement & Repository Badges - Implementation Plan

## Objective
Enhance VideoTranscript.app documentation structure with comprehensive markdown files, repository badges, and proper cross-references between CLAUDE.md, README.md, and docs/ directory.

## Current State
- `docs/` contains only `swagger.yaml`
- `CLAUDE.md` has comprehensive development guidance but no docs references
- `README.md` is detailed but could be better organized with docs links
- No repository badges present

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Comprehensive Documentation Structure
- `docs/api.md` - API endpoint documentation and examples
- `docs/architecture.md` - Technical architecture and design patterns
- `docs/deployment.md` - Production deployment guides
- `docs/development.md` - Development setup and workflows
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `docs/contributing.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `docs/changelog.md` - Version history and changes

### 2. Add Repository Badges
- Go version badge
- License badge (MIT)
- Go Report Card
- Repository stats
- Documentation status

### 3. Update CLAUDE.md
- Add references to all docs files
- Maintain development-focused content
- Link to specific sections in docs

### 4. Restructure README.md
- Add badges section at top
- Create table of contents with docs links
- Move detailed sections to docs files
- Keep essential quick-start information

## Success Criteria
- All documentation files created and properly cross-referenced
- Repository badges functional and up-to-date
- CLAUDE.md enhanced with docs references
- README.md streamlined with clear navigation to docs
- All links tested and working
