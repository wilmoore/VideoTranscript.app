# Feature: Whisper.cpp Native Integration

## Overview
Implement native Go whisper.cpp integration to replace the current demo transcription system with real speech-to-text processing.

## Problem Statement
- Current system uses mock/demo transcription instead of real AI transcription
- Dependency issues with `github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/bindings/go` package
- Need seamless model management and configuration

## Requirements
1. **Native Integration**: Use whisper.cpp Go bindings for real transcription
2. **Model Management**: Automated model download and configuration via Makefile
3. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Fall back to demo transcription if whisper setup fails
4. **Performance Safeguards**: Memory limits, timeouts, audio length restrictions

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Dependency Resolution
- Research alternative Go whisper libraries without CGO conflicts
- Test different versions/commits of official bindings
- Implement basic whisper.cpp integration with error handling

### Phase 2: Model Management
- Add Makefile targets for model download and setup
- Create model download scripts for whisper base model
- Environment variable configuration for model paths

### Phase 3: Integration & Performance
- Replace demo transcription logic with real whisper processing
- Add performance safeguards (30min audio limit, 10min timeout)
- Comprehensive error handling and user guidance

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Real whisper.cpp transcription working end-to-end
- ✅ `make setup-whisper` downloads models and configures environment
- ✅ Graceful fallback if whisper unavailable
- ✅ No errors, clear setup instructions for users
- ✅ Performance within acceptable limits

## Files to Modify
- `go.mod` - Add working whisper.cpp dependency
- `lib/transcription.go` - Replace demo logic with whisper integration
- `config/config.go` - Add whisper model path configuration
- `Makefile` - Add model download and setup targets
- `models/` - Directory for whisper model files

## Definition of Done
- Real speech-to-text transcription working
- Easy setup via Makefile
- No build errors or dependency conflicts
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated
